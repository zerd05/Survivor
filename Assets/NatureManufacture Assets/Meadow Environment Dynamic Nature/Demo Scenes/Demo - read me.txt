Simple extended demo scene will be hosted in about 1-2 weeks after release.

Unity terrain doesn't support custom grass shaders that's why we use Vegetation Studio Pro, old Vegetation Studio could be used too or any other custom grass solution.


Unity terrain 2018.3+ will probably support custom grass shading on unity terrain object - this mean we will create full demo for this version.
